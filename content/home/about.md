# Biography

Shaun Wilkinson is a computational biologist trying to make sense 
of the jumble of genetic juice known as the ocean. 

A Kiwi living and working in Timor-Leste, Shaun is analyzing the 
genetic signature of seawater to catalogue the many different species 
inhabiting the coral reefs of Atauro, Dili and Manatuto. 
This involves developing new machine-learning algorithms to decipher 
the billions of DNA molecules that are continuously released by 
marine flora and fauna during processes such as metabolism and 
reproduction.

After gaining his PhD from Victoria University of Wellington in 2015, 
Shaun was awarded a prestigious Rutherford Foundation Postdoctoral 
Fellowship by the Royal Society of New Zealand. 
This enabled him to continue his research while accompanying his 
wife Alice on diplomatic assignment to the New Zealand Embassy in 
Dili.

Shaun's research could reduce the need for expensive and 
laborious visual surveys, and may provide a practical monitoring 
solution to rapidly detect changes in the ecosystem arising 
from global warming and other human impacts.
