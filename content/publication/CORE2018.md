abstract_short = "Reef-building corals are nutritionally dependent on the symbiotic alga Symbiodiniaceae, and may select for high-performing symbiont lineages. However, the effects of fine-scale genetic variation within symbiont populations on host performance are not well understood. We measured the relative abundance of intra-genomically variable (IGV) Symbiodinium cells and those with homogeneous rDNA sequence repeats, and analysed their physical status and photosynthetic performance under temperature stress. The comparatively poor performance of heterogeneous symbiont cells suggests either a direct deleterious effect of IGV or reduced performance associated with inter-species recombination."
