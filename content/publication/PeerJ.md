abstract_short = "High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a simple and cost-effective solution for aquatic biodiversity assessments. Yet several analytical challenges remain, including the incorporation of robust statistical inference in the assignment of taxonomic identities. We present a new supervised machine-learning algorithm that incorporates full probabistic models to classify eDNA with improved recall and strict control over false discovery rates."
