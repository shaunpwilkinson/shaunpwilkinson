abstract_short = "The symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals are essential to the development of shallow-water tropical reefs. Most genetic variation arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations that arise during asexual reproduction, but increasing evidence suggests a role of cryptic recombination in the Symbiodiniaceae family. We used quantitative PCR to estimate proportions of genetically homogeneous symbionts and intra-genomically variable Symbiodiniaceae in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis. The abundance of IGV symbionts varied between colonies within and between sites, but remained stable within colonies through time. The local thermal maximum emerged as a negative predictor for IGV symbiont abundance, consistent with an increased susceptibility to thermal stress. This suggests that the evolutionary processes that generate IGV (such as inter-lineage recombination and the accumulation of somatic mutations at the ITS2 locus) may have important implications for the fitness of the symbiont and that of the coral host."
