abstract_short = "To persist in oligotrophic waters, reef-building corals rely on nutritional interactions with symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, but the true diversity of this family remains poorly characterised. In this paper, we assess Symbiodiniaceae richness at Atauro Island (Timor-Leste) as well as on reefs of the neighbouring Timor mainland using next-generation DNA sequencing. Our results reveal a symbiont richness that reflects the high biodiversity of these reefs, but also potentially negative effects of proximal human populations on Symbiodiniaceae, even when previous studies have shown corals to be largely unaffected."
